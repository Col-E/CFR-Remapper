# JRemapper

An easy to use GUI for remapping classes, methods, and fields of compiled java programs. 

For information on how to use JRemapper and other details about it, check out [the wiki](https://github.com/Col-E/JRemapper/wiki). 

The TLDR usage is as follows:

* Global keybinds
    * `Control + N` Open a jar file
    * `Control + O` Open mappings file
    * `Control + E` Export jar file _(mappings are applied to output)_ 
    * `Control + S` Save mappings to file _(Json)_
    * `Control + Z` Undo mapping change
    * `Control + Y` Redo mapping change
* Editor pane keybinds
    * `N` Navigate to selected item
    * `Backspace` Go to last item
